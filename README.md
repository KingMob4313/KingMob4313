- 👋 Hi, I’m @KingMob4313! (he/him - we/us)
- 👀 I’m interested in my own weird little projects of personal utility.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ML & Python because neither can be avoided these days and Assembly because I am a hacker at heart.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on rom hacks, game mods/hacking and little else.
